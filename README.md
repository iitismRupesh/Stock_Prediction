# Stock-Market-Forcasting

In this project, the primary focus is on building a machine learning model specifically for stock market prediction. 
The method used for this prediction is based on Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, 
which are a type of deep learning architecture known for their ability to handle sequential data effectively.

Stock market prediction involves attempting to forecast the future prices of company stocks or other financial instruments traded on a financial exchange. 
Accurate predictions in the stock market are highly valuable for investors and traders, as they can help make informed decisions about when to buy, sell, 
or hold particular stocks, ultimately leading to better investment outcomes.

The choice of using Stacked LSTM in this project is motivated by its capacity to capture complex patterns and dependencies present in sequential data, 
such as historical stock prices and trading volumes. LSTM models are well-suited for time series data, making them suitable for stock market prediction, 
where past trends and patterns are crucial indicators for future price movements.

By training the Stacked LSTM model on historical stock market data, 
the goal is to enable it to learn from past patterns and trends and use this knowledge to make accurate predictions about future stock prices. 
The model's ability to capture long-term dependencies and patterns helps in providing more robust and reliable forecasts.

Overall, the project aims to leverage the power of deep learning and Stacked LSTM networks to build a robust machine learning model that can offer valuable insights,
into the future value of company stocks and other financial instruments, 
thereby assisting investors and traders in making well-informed decisions in the dynamic and complex stock market environment.
